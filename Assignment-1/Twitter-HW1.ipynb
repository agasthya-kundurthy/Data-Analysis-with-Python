    "A simple Sentiment Analysis is to performed to understand the data obtained(tweets) from twitter based on a trending topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people use Twitter as a platform to share and comment on their views about any topic. So, twitter is chosen to gather data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trending topic chosen here is 'snowday' as snowfall has started in many places all over the world due to the start of winter. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Accomplished Tasks:\n",
    "* Worked with and configured access to a Twitter API.\n",
    "* Identified a trending topic on Twitter - 'snowday'.\n",
    "* Lists of stop words, positive words, and negative words were obtained from Github.\n",
    "* A ratio of the positive and negative words has been arrived at to understand the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions Answered:\n",
    "* What is the ratio of positive to negative words on your trending topic?\n",
    "* What is your interpretation of the ratio?\n",
    "* What is the managerial insight that you could offer based on your results?\n"

A country or state wise graph could be possible based on a larger dataset, this would help us compare the sentiments of tweets from a particular region and a clearer relationship could be formed with the temperature of the region in consideration which could lead to having better insights and probably a different ratio than the current ratio.\n",
